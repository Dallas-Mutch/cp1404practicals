# CP1404 - Dallas Mutch
- Hi, I’m Dallas
- I’m interested in comic books, books, video games, cricket and sim racing
- I’m currently learning Bachelors of IT
## About the repo
- The repo is about the progress of learning different techniques of code and how it has changed from practical 1 to practical 10
## What I have learned
- One main lesson is outlining the correct naming of variables, and they have meaning behind the names
- Do not repeat yourself, if you see the same code being repeated then there must be a better way to present it
- For menu codes it is always good to create functions that serve a purpose
